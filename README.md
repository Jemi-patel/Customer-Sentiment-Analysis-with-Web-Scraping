FlowerAura, Web scraping, data processing, and sentiment analysis combine to provide actionable insights into customer satisfaction from online reviews. Overview This project provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing customer sentiment from web-scraped reviews. Using a combination of web scraping, data processing, and sentiment analysis, the project aims to deliver actionable insights into customer satisfaction and product performance. The process involves collecting approximately 100 customer reviews from a target website, cleaning and structuring the data, and then performing sentiment analysis to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Finally, the results are visualized to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the findings.

Features Automated Web Scraping: Collects a large number of customer reviews efficiently using Selenium.

Data Cleaning and Processing: Utilizes Pandas to clean, process, and structure the raw review data.

Sentiment Analysis: Employs TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of each review.

Visualizations: Generates insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:

Sentiment distribution bar charts.

Word clouds of positive and negative keywords.

Analysis of review length versus sentiment.

Libraries and Tools Selenium: Used for automating the web scraping process by interacting with a web browser.

BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used here to extract specific review details.

Pandas: A powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, used for data cleaning and structuring.

TextBlob: Provides a simple API for performing sentiment analysis on text data.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

Results The project delivers key insights through its visualizations and data analysis. The sentiment distribution plots provide a clear overview of customer satisfaction, while the word clouds highlight common themes and key phrases in both positive and negative reviews. The review length analysis helps to understand if longer, more detailed reviews tend to be more positive or negative. These insights can be invaluable for businesses looking to improve their products and services.
